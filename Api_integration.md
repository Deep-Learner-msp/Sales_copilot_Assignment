3. State Management Details
State management in the K2K Connect Final app is handled using Redux. The primary focus is managing session state and conversation history to ensure smooth, consistent user experiences across different features of the app.

Key Elements of State Management:
Session State: The app stores conversation history and session data using Hooks and Redux. Each feature, like "Sales Assistant," "Market Insights," and "Pitch Creator," maintains its own conversation state, which is stored in hooks and Redux.
Conversation History: As the user interacts with the app (e.g., through chat input), the app keeps a log of the conversation in Redux. This history is used to provide contextual responses from the APIs, especially for features like the Pitch Creator, where the conversation history is used to generate the final pitch presentation.
Redux Actions: Redux actions are dispatched when the user sends a message or when an API response is received. These actions update the store with new conversation data.
Redux Selectors: The app uses selectors to access the conversation history for each feature, ensuring consistent data retrieval.
Example of Redux Slice for Conversation History:
tsx
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
  conversationHistory: [],
  pitchPresentation: null
};

const pitchCreatorSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'pitchCreator',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setConversationHistory: (state, action) => {
      state.conversationHistory = action.payload;
    },
    setPitchPresentation: (state, action) => {
      state.pitchPresentation = action.payload;
    }
  }
});

export const { setConversationHistory, setPitchPresentation } = pitchCreatorSlice.actions;
export default pitchCreatorSlice.reducer;
In the example above:

setConversationHistory: Updates the conversation history as the user interacts with the app.
setPitchPresentation: Stores the final pitch presentation after being generated by the Pitch Creator API.
